# Todo app

This is a app I built to help track tasks through out the day. It's created using React and Firestore and hosted using Firebase hosting.

## Installation

To use this app:

Visit https://todo-app-eb418.firebaseapp.com

Alternatively:

1. Clone the Todo app from GitHub
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the app
3. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the app

## Usage

This app uses basic CRUD operations.

You can:

1. Create a task
2. View current tasks that are either complete or to be completed
3. Toggle a task based on whether it has been completed or not
4. Update a tasks name/title
5. Delete a task

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking a lot at my app and am always open to suggestions.
